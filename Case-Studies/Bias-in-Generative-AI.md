# 🔎 Bias in Generative AI

## 📌 What is Bias?

Bias in Generative AI refers to unfair, skewed, or stereotypical outputs produced by AI systems due to imbalanced or historically biased training data.

AI models learn patterns from massive datasets.  
If those datasets contain social, cultural, or historical biases, the model may reproduce them.

AI does not “intend” to be biased — it reflects patterns in its training data.

## 🛠 Why This Matters

Bias in AI can:
- Reinforce stereotypes
- Influence hiring systems unfairly
- Affect automated decision-making
- Create social harm at scale

---

## 🔍 My Learning & Analysis

Through experimentation, I observed that:
- Prompt phrasing significantly affects bias level.
- Neutral role-based prompts reduce stereotypical outputs.
- Explicit fairness instructions improve response balance.

## 🚀 Conclusion

Understanding bias is essential for responsible prompt engineering.  
Ethical AI design requires awareness, testing, and continuous evaluation.
