# 🧪 Zero-Shot vs Few-Shot Prompting

## 📌 Objective

To compare how model outputs differ between zero-shot and few-shot prompting techniques.

---

## 🔹 Zero-Shot Prompt

Prompt:
> Summarize the importance of exercise.

### Output Characteristics:
- General explanation
- Broad statements
- Less structured

---

## 🔹 Few-Shot Prompt

>
> Now summarize the importance of exercise.

### Output Characteristics:
- More structured
- More specific
- Better clarity

---

## 📊 Observations

- Few-shot prompting improves response precision.
- Examples guide model behavior.
- Output tone becomes more controlled.

---

## 🚀 Conclusion

Few-shot prompting provides better structured and context-aware responses compared to zero-shot prompting.
